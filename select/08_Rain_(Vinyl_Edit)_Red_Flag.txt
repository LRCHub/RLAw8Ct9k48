It seems to be raining on my water colored painting
The love we have today will never turn into grey
I love you more than I know, or ever could show
For now and always
(Forever and a moment)
(Forever and a day)
I'm tempted in your presence, and I long to hold you near
The thought of you complacent is the only thing I fear
More than I know or ever could show
For now and always
(Forever and a moment)
(Forever and a day)
Seasons change
But they can't change my mind
I'm being stubborn this time
For now and always
(Endeavor forever)
(Endeavor forever)
(Endeavor forever)
It seems to have stopped raining on my water colored painting
I sense that what remains is well within the grasp of change
More than I know or ever could show
For now and always
My respect for you has reason, on this we both can trust
Deny me, please deny me, at times I know I must
More than I know or ever could show
For now and always
(Forever and a moment)
(Forever and a day)
Seasons change
But they can't change my mind
I'm being stubborn this time
For now and always
(Endeavor forever)
(Endeavor forever)
Seasons change
But they can't change my mind
I'm being stubborn this time
For now and always
