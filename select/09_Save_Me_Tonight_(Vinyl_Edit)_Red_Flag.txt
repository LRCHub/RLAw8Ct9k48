Save me tonight
Tonight

Have you seen her
Have you been near to her?
I believe that I would, if only I could
I know what it means to her

Time flails her arms around my world
You're safe here, girl, all warm and curled up
Inside my room we'll find some room
I'll say it over, you're staying over

CHORUS
Save me tonight
You know what's wrong and how to make it alright
Save me tonight
You pave the way to the morning light

VERSE 3
Some things, my love, are better done than said
Your eyes they speak, you're easily read
From page to page, cover to cover
Like reading a book, I'm reading my lover

CHORUS

Looking backs on the things I've read
I often think of the things I've said
A gentle word, and angry shout
An idle threat to move on out
But in the end, yes, in the end
I'd gained a lover, I'd gained a friend
A gentle word, and angry shout
All the while we work it out

Oo
Mm

VERSE 3

CHORUS

Save me tonight
Well, I know what it means to her
Tonight
'Cause, you see, I've been near to her
Tonight
Tonight
